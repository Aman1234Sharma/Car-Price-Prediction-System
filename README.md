# Car-Price-Prediction-System
This repository hosts a machine learning project focused on predicting car prices based on various features, including the car's name, manufacturer, and fuel type. The predictive model employed for this task is Multiple Linear Regression, which achieved an RÂ² score of 87%, indicating a strong correlation between the selected features and the predicted car prices.

## Car Price Prediction Pipeline
## 1. Data Collection :
* Gather data on car features such as name, company, fuel type, etc., and their corresponding prices.
* All the data was scraped from Quikr.com.

## 2. Data Preprocessing :
* Clean the data by handling missing values,duplicates,datatype correction,vague data, outliers, and inconsistencies.
  
## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
* Explore and visualize the relationships between different features and the target variable (Car Price).
* EDA  helps us to get valuable insights about  the data and outliers are easily spotted.
* Box Plots,Dist Plots,Histograms and Scatter Plots  were used for the same purpose.

## 4.Feature Engineering :
* Feature Transformation was done to get approx normalize curve of price column as Algorithms work better on normalized curve
* Categorical variables were converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding to make them compatible with machine learning algorithm
* Scaling was done to ensure that all features have the same scale.

## 5. Data Splitting :
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
## 6.Model Training :
* We choose Multiple Linear Regresiion Model to train the model.

# 7. Model Evaluation :
* Model's performance was evaluated  using the R2 score.
* Our R2 Score : 0.87
# 8. Result Visualization :
* Plotted Actual Vs Predicted Price Chart
